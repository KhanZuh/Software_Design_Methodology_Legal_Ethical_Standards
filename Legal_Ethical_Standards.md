# Legal and Ethical standards

> **Scenario 1**
> BankingCorp are one of the leading retail banks in the country, offering a full range of products including current accounts, savings products, credit cards and loans. They have in-depth knowledge of their customers' income, financial commitments and spending habits. They already offer some products where customers can pay a monthly fee and receive benefits in return. Some of these benefits include special offers from a curated list of third-party partners which customers can opt-in to receiving.

> They have recently been approached by a payday loan company who want to send direct marketing to users struggling to pay their credit card bills. The loan company want to email the customers they feel would be most likely to use their services but acknowledge that manually identifying targets would be time-consuming and want to develop an algorithm to automate this. BankingCorp have given them access to their systems to test this algorithm, ensuring it works with real customer data. The loan company have had some negative publicity recently and so BankingCorp will not be announcing this new partnership publicly. Instead they will inform customers in an email explaining the changes to their terms and conditions.
## Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

BankingCorp may be breaking several laws with this proposal.

1. Sharing customer data with a third-party without explicit consent violates data protection laws, such as GDPR.
2. Using customer data to target vulnerable individuals for payday loans without their consent could potentially violate consumer protection laws.

## What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

1. Privacy Violation: Sharing customer data without their consent breaches their privacy rights.
2. Exploiting Vulnerable Customers: Targeting individuals struggling with credit card bills for payday loans could be seen as exploiting their financial difficulties for profit.
3. Lack of Transparency: Not informing customers about the partnership and the use of their data is unethical as it deprives them of the opportunity to make an informed decision about their personal information.

## What could the company do to address these issues?

Banking need to do damage control and implement measures that demonstrate their commitment to protecting customer privacy and well-being.

1. Obtain Explicit Consent: BankingCorp should obtain explicit consent from customers before sharing their data with third parties for marketing purposes.
2. Transparent Communication: They should be transparent about any partnerships and how customer data will be used, ensuring customers are fully informed.
3. Ethical Review: Conduct an ethical review of the partnership to ensure it aligns with the company's values and does not exploit vulnerable customers.
4. Legal Compliance: Ensure that any data sharing and marketing practices comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as GDPR and consumer protection laws.
5. Consider Alternative Partnerships: Instead of partnering with a payday loan company, BankingCorp could explore partnerships with organizations offering financial counseling or assistance to help struggling customers manage their finances responsibly.

> **Scenario 2**
>
> The new mobile game Treasure Hunters has been taking the country by storm. Players are shown an illustrated map and must find the hidden treasure by following clues and solving > puzzles. The quicker a player finds the treasure the more points they score and they can compare their scores with their friends. Five new maps are added every day and each map can be > completed in a few minutes, with the low time commitment making the game a huge hit with casual players. There are many players who would like more puzzles, though.

> The developers have been taken aback by the success of the game and are struggling to keep up with demand. They have had to spin up more servers and are looking to hire more engineers to keep working on content. That costs money though, and they are looking to monetise the game. Instead of adding new maps daily they will continually be adding more which players can unlock by completing existing maps. Players will be able to spend their points to unlock hints which will help them progress faster. Hints will also be available to purchase using real-world money, with the possibility of offering multi-buy discounts at a later date.


## Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

**Legal Considerations:**

1. GDPR Compliance: The game likely collects user data such as location, device information, and possibly personal identifiers if users log in. Ensuring compliance with GDPR regarding user data collection, storage, and usage is essential.
2. Monetization Regulations: If the game introduces in-app purchases using real-world money, it must adhere to laws and regulations regarding online transactions, especially concerning minors who might play the game.
3. Copyright and Intellectual Property: If the game includes any copyrighted content or trademarks in its puzzles or maps, the company must ensure they have proper licenses or permissions to use them.

## What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

**Ethical Concerns:**

- Monetization Practices: Introducing in-app purchases, especially for hints, can create a pay-to-win scenario, where players who spend more money have an unfair advantage over others. This undermines the fairness and enjoyment of the game for those who cannot or do not wish to spend money.
- Addictive Design Patterns: The game's design, particularly its addictive nature and the constant addition of new content, may contribute to excessive gaming habits, especially among vulnerable demographics like children and individuals prone to addictive behaviors.
- Data Privacy: Collecting user data for monetization purposes without transparently informing users or obtaining proper consent raises concerns about privacy and data exploitation.

## What could the company do to address these issues?

To address these issues, the company could prioritize transparency and user consent regarding data collection practices, ensuring compliance with GDPR requirements. They could also implement fair monetization practices, such as offering non-monetary ways for players to progress and avoiding pay-to-win mechanics. 

Responsible game design principles could be incorporated to mitigate addictive elements and promote healthy gaming habits, such as implementing playtime limits and promoting breaks during gameplay sessions. By proactively addressing these legal and ethical considerations, the company can maintain player trust, comply with regulations, and cultivate a positive gaming experience for all users.

> **Scenario 3**
>
> `friends.com` is a new match-making service to help people socialise when they move to a new area. Users enter their area and a list of their interests before being shown a list of people with similar interests in the area. There's no guarantee of an exact match in interests and the suggested friend could be on the opposite side of the city. Users can freely view each others' profiles and message each other, but the matching service will speed up the process of making new contacts. The site is free with revenue coming from generic banner ads on the page. Their development plans involve adding a premium membership which will lock many of the existing features behind a paywall. Free users will only be able to view limited versions of profiles and have a daily cap on the number of matches which can be made. Premium users, on the other hand, will now have more specific location settings and be able to filter their matches. To advertise the premium service the free-tier users will be given occasional "trial periods" of the premium tier followed by adverts showing them what they could unlock by subscribing. Additionally the generic banner ads will be replaced by more targeted advertising for local businesses. Users' location data will be shared in order to ensure relevant businesses are being advertised.

## Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?

The company's existing plan does not immediately violate existing law. But an emphasis on strict compliance with data protection regulations, particularly concerning the handling and sharing of users' personal information, including location data, for advertising purposes is necessary to avoid straying into dangerous territory for the company. 

## What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?

Ethical concerns emerge regarding potential disparities between free and premium users, as the introduction of a paywall for certain features may inadvertently create socioeconomic barriers, limiting access to essential functionalities for those unable to afford the premium service. Furthermore, the proposed advertising strategy, which involves enticing free users with periodic trial periods of premium features followed by promotional materials urging subscription, raises questions about the ethicality of persuasive marketing tactics and the transparency of the subscription model.

## What could the company do to address these issues?

To address these multifaceted issues, the company must prioritize transparency and user consent by clearly articulating how user data will be utilized and providing opt-out mechanisms for targeted advertising. Additionally, ensuring fairness and inclusivity across user tiers is imperative, potentially through offering a reasonable level of functionality to free users while maintaining value-added benefits for premium subscribers. Ethical advertising practices should be adopted, emphasizing honesty, integrity, and respect for user autonomy, while empowering users with comprehensive information and control over their subscription preferences.
